As I've wrapped up numerous cycles of qualitative coding of interview data for my dissertation, *Into the edu-verse: New teachersâ€™ agency in self-directed learning with social media*, I used `geom_tile()` in **{ggplot2}** to create heatmap plots to help me quickly visualize how thematic codes varied by interview participant and by modality.

## Codes by Participant

![Themes by participant](/img/dissertation-themes-heatmap-sorted2.png)

## Codes by Modality

I've shared the code to produce these plots in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bretsw/dissertation-themes), and you can also [view on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/bretsw/dissertation-themes) a variety of different heatmaps I created en route to these final plots.
